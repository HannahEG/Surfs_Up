## Weather Differences: 

The difference in temperature between June and December over the course of seven years is not necessarily significant. The maximum degree of difference between Highest Temps and Average Temps is 2 degrees and approximately 4 degrees, respectively.

December does have a Lowest Temp 8 degrees lower than June. However, it is important to consider even a low of 54 degrees is likely to be desireable for individuals seeking to get away from much lower freezing temperatures elsewhere.

Further analysis should include a review of frequency of temperatures in order to determine whether lows, highs, and averages are truly representative of daily temps for winter and summer months.
